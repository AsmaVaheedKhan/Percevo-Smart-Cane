# Percevo-Smart-Cane
#With the recent advancement of AI technologies, many traditional tools have been enhanced to improve the quality of life for people with different impairments. 
#One such field is technology for the visually impaired, where current solutions focus more on navigation and less on helping the visually impaired to understand their environment. 
#This repository presents Percevo, an AI-powered smart cane attachment that provides real-time descriptions of the environment. 
#Equipped with a camera and AI algorithms, Percevo detects, recognizes, and provides information about nearby objects, including their distance from the user. 
#Additionally, it incorporates an ultrasonic sensor for collision avoidance, and vibration sensors extend its utility to users with hearing impairments. 
#A physical prototype of Percevo was developed and tested in an indoor environment, demonstrating its potential to enhance quality of life for users with visual and hearing impairments. 
#This work highlights the potential of AI technologies for assistive devices and encourages continued exploration with larger datasets to further refine the system.
